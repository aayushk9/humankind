## Human Kind

### A gentle reminder that we're still present for each other

## Purpose

The motive behind building this website is simple to keep human connections alive.  
We, as humans share an innate sense of connectivity, but often tend to forget it.  
So I thought of creating a nice app that spreads positivity, nurtures human connection and promotes a better state of mind for everyone.
